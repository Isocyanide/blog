      <p>This is a famous theorem in elementary number theory which is suited to answer a specific type of question whose first appearance was seen in Chinese literature, and hence the name Chinese Remainder Theorem. The question asks - &ldquo;Find the positive integers which give remainders \(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\) when divided by \(n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4\) respectively.&rdquo; We first derive the mathematical tools required to tackle the problem.</p>
<h3 id="linear-congruences">Linear Congruences</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, we deal with congruences such as \(ax \equiv b \ (mod \ n) \). However it&rsquo;s just a fancy notation for \(ax - b = ny\) or \(ax -ny = b\) where \(y\) is an arbitrary integer. This reduces to a linear Diophantine equation, which has solutions in the form of an arithmetic progression.<br>
\(x = x_0 + \frac{n}{d}t\) where \(x_0\) is any solution, \(d = gcd(a,n)\) and \(t\) is an arbitrary integer.<br>
We are only interested in the solutions in-congruent to \(n\). For example, for n = 7, if \(x=3\) satisfies, that is, \(3a \equiv b \ (mod \ 7)\) that implies \(x = 10 \equiv 3 \ (mod \ 7)\) also satisfies the same. The point here is that \(x=3, 10, 17, 24\) etc are the same solution as \(x \equiv 3\). Hence all the solutions can be reduced to one of the residues modulo \(n = (0,1,2..n-1)\).</p>
<p>We argue that there are exactly \(d = gcd(a,n)\) in-congruent solutions. Consider,</p>
<p>$$ x_0, x_0 + \frac{n}{d}, x_0 + 2\frac{n}{d}&hellip;x_0 + (d-1)\frac{n}{d} $$</p>
<p>If any two of them were to be congruent, we would have, 
$$    x_0 + i\frac{n}{d} \equiv x_0 + j\frac{n}{d} \ (mod \ n) $$
$$    i\frac{n}{d} \equiv j\frac{n}{d} \ (mod \ n) $$
$$    i \equiv j \ (mod \ n/gcd(n,\frac{n}{d})) $$
$$    i \equiv j \ (mod \ d) $$</p>
<p>We know that the last statement is impossible. Now lets consider an arbitrary solution of \(x\) where \(t = qd + r\) and \(r&lt;d\). We have</p>
<p>$$    x_0 + \frac{n}{d}t \equiv x_0 + \frac{n}{d}(qd+r)\equiv x_0 + nq + \frac{n}{d}r $$
$$  \equiv x_0 + \frac{n}{d}r $$</p>
<p>Where \(r&lt;d\) which is one of our selected \(d\) solutions. So we have proved that \(ax \equiv b \ (mod \ n)\) has \(d = gcd(a.n)\) mutually in-congruent solutions.</p>
<h3 id="chinese-remainder-theorem">Chinese Remainder Theorem</h3>
<p>Let \(n_1, n_2&hellip;n_r\) be positive integers that \(gcd(n_i, n_j) = 1\) for \(i \neq j\). Then the system of linear congruences : \(x \equiv a_1 \ (mod \ n_1), x \equiv a_2 \ (mod \ n_2)&hellip;..x \equiv a_r \ (mod \ n_r)\) admits a simultaneous solution, unique modulo to the integer \(n = n_1n_2&hellip;n_r\)</p>
<p>We start by assigning \(N_i = \frac{n}{n_i} = n_1..n_{i-1}n_{i+1}..n_r\). Since all the \(n\)&lsquo;s are relatively prime, \(gcd(N_k, n_k) = 1\). By the theory of linear congruences, we know that the congruence \(N_kx \equiv 1 \ (mod \ 1)\) admits \(d=1\), that is, a unique solution. Let&rsquo;s call it \(x_k\). Consider the integer:</p>
<p>$$  N = a_1N_1x_1 + a_2N_2x_2 + &hellip; a_rN_rx_r $$</p>
<p>We argue that this integer is the required solution. Indeed, \(N_k \equiv 0 \ (mod \ n_i)\) for \(k \neq i\) as \(N_k\) contains a \(n_i\) factor. Hence we only need to consider \(N \equiv a_kN_kx_k \ (mod \ n)\). By our selection of \(x_k\) we know that \(N_kx_k \equiv 1 \ (mod \ 1) \implies a_kN_kx_k \equiv a_k \equiv N \ (mod \ n_k)\) which was to be proved.</p>
<p>All that&rsquo;s left is to prove that it is unique modulo \(n_1n_2&hellip;n_r\). Let \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) be two simultaneous solutions. 
$$ x_1 \equiv a_1 \equiv x_2 \ (mod \ n_1) $$
$$    .   $$
$$. $$
$$ x_1 \equiv a_r \equiv x_2 \ (mod \ n_r) $$
Putting all of them together yields \(x_1 \equiv x_2 \ (mod \ n_1n_2&hellip;n_r)\). Now we have proved both the aspects of the theorem and the job is done!</p>
<p>Here a problem to solve using the theorem : When eggs in a basket are removed \(2,3,4,5,6\) at a time there remain, respectively \(1,2,3,4,5\) eggs. When they are taken out \(7\) at a time there are none left. Find the smallest number of eggs there could have been in the basket.</p>
