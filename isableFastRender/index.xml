      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss a couple examples where Pigeonhole principle is employed. In case you don&amp;rsquo;t know what the Pigeonhole principle is, you can read my post on it. Here is the link.
The Friendship Theorem Among six people, there are always three who know each other or three who are complete strangers.
How can one establish such a statement using mathematics? It almost sounds preposterous! Here we use another concept well known to us but appears to be unrelated - Geometry.</description>

      <title>The Pigeonhole Principle</title>

      <description>The Pigeonhole Principle (or the Box Principle) looks obvious and straightforward on first glance but it has a very widespread application. It shows itself in the most unexpected of places and the proofs involving it are striking examples of mathematical elegance.
So what is this principle? In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll write about a version of this principle which I find more intuitive. Here you have a certain number of pigeons which you must place inside a certain number of holes.</description>

      <description>For positive integers \(a,b\) where \(gcd(a,b) = 1\), the equation \(ax + by = n\) always has a solution in positive \(x,y\) for all \(n \geq ab\) Proof
Since \(gcd(a,b) = 1\), by the theory of linear Diophantine equations, we know that there always exists solutions (infinitely many of them) for \(ax + by = n\). However we are only interested in the ones where both \(x\) and \(y\) are positive.</description>

      <title>The Math behind a Calendar</title>

      <description>Backstory We all know that the earth takes 365 days to complete one revolution around the sun&amp;hellip;or does it? Well, not quite. It takes approximately 365.2422 days. The early Julian Calendar (introduced by Julius Caesar) rounded off the decimal to one-fourths which accumulated to a day once every four years. Hence a day was added to every year (in Febuary as I&amp;rsquo;m sure you know) once in four years. This year was termed a leap year.</description>
