      <description>For positive integers \(a,b\) where \(gcd(a,b) = 1\), the equation \(ax + by = n\) always has a solution in positive \(x,y\) for all \(n \geq ab\) \
Proof
Since \(gcd(a,b) = 1\), by the theory of linear Diophantine equations, we know that there always exists solutions (infinitely many of them) for \(ax + by = n\). However we are only interested in the ones where both \(x\) and \(y\) are positive.</description>
