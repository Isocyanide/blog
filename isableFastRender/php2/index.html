      <p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll discuss a couple examples where Pigeonhole principle is employed. In case you don&rsquo;t know what the Pigeonhole principle is, you can read my post on it. <a href="https://isocyanide.github.io/php1/">Here</a> is the link.</p>
<h3 id="the-friendship-theorem">The Friendship Theorem</h3>
<p><em>Among six people, there are always three who know each other or three who are complete strangers.</em></p>
<p>How can one establish such a statement using mathematics? It almost sounds preposterous! Here we use another concept well known to us but appears to be unrelated - Geometry. Consider a hexagon where every vertex \(A,B,C,D,E,F\) denotes a person. Now we join all the vertices by either a red line or a blue line. Two points joined by a red line implies that the two people represented by the points are strangers while the blue line represents friends (or simply people who know each other).</p>
<p>Lets start with person A. There are \(5\) lines leading away from A which can be either red or blue. This is where the Pigeonhole principle kicks in. Let &lsquo;red&rsquo; and &lsquo;blue&rsquo; be holes and the \(5\) lines be pigeons. Since \(\frac{n}{k} = \frac{5}{3}\) is not an integer, one of the holes has at least \([\frac{n}{k}] + 1 = 3\) lines. Without loss of generality, let the three lines be blue.</p>
<p><img src="/hexagon.jpg#center" alt="hexagon"></p>
<p>Now if any one of \(CD\) or \(DE\) or \(CE\) is blue, we have a blue triangle implying the existence of \(3\) people who know each other mutually. Otherwise if \(CD\), \(DE\) and \(CE\) are all red, we have a red triangle \(CED\) implying the existence of \(3\) people who are mutually strangers. The statement has been proved.</p>
<h3 id="a-geometrical-problem">A Geometrical Problem</h3>
<p><em>If a disk of radius one contains seven points with mutual distance \(\geq 1.\) Prove that one of the points is the center of the disk.</em></p>
<p>You might be wondering - where are the holes? Well, we make our own holes!</p>
<p><img src="/circle.jpg#center" alt="circle"></p>
<p>Each one of the \(6\) partitions is a &lsquo;hole&rsquo; while the \(7\) points are &lsquo;pigeons&rsquo;. So one of the parition contains at least \([\frac{7}{6}] + 1 = 2\) points. However this is impossible. Let the two points be  \(P\) and \(Q\). Since they are inside the partition, the angle between them \( \angle POQ &lt; 60^{\degree}\) and \(OP\) and \(OQ \leq\) radius \(=1\) (\(O\) being the centre of the cirlce). By the cosine rule, it is easy to verify \(PQ &lt; 1\) which violates the given condition.
The only other alternative is to have one of the points as centre and indeed if we place the rest \(6\) points at a separation of \(60^{\degree}\) on the circumference, we are left with the situation described in the question.</p>
<p>After a little experience, identifying questions which require the pigeonhole principle becomes quite easy. The idea of dividing a geometrical shape to accommodate the points is a powerful technique and the key to a lot of problems.</p>
